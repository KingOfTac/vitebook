# Vitebook Core

This package extends Vite with a custom CLI and application bootstrap process. The foundation
is library-agnostic and is built to be extended via plugins. The client-side implementation is
provided by other packages such as `@vitebook/svelte`.

```bash
npm install @vitebook/core
```
