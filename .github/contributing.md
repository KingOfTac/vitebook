# Contributing Guide

First off, thank you for taking the time to contribute to Vitebook. You'll find instructions below
on how to get yourself up and running so you can create your first PR.

## üéí Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Let's setup our machine. The only software you'll need to install is:

- [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- [volta](https://docs.volta.sh/guide) or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
  (we recommend volta)

They're very easy to install, just follow the links and you should be up and running in no time.

### Fork & Clone

Next, head over to the [Vitebook repository on GitHub][vitebook] and click the `Fork` button in the
top right corner. After the project has been forked, run the following commands in your terminal...

```bash
# Replace {github-username} with your GitHub username.
$: git clone https://github.com/{github-username}/vitebook --depth=1

$: cd vitebook

$: pnpm install
```

**OPTIONAL:** Now it'll help if we keep our `main` branch pointing at the original repository and make
pull requests from the forked branch.

```bash
# Add the original repository as a "remote" called "upstream".
$: git remote add upstream git@github.com:vitebook/vitebook.git

# Fetch the git information from the remote.
$: git fetch upstream

# Set your local main branch to use the upstream main branch whenver you run `git pull`.
$: git branch --set-upstream-to=upstream/main main

# Run this when we want to update our version of main.
$: git pull
```

### Node

Once you're done simply set your Node version to match the required version by Vitebook. If you've
installed `volta` then it will automatically pin it, and if you're using `nvm` simply run `nvm use`
from the project root.

## üíº Package Manager (PNPM)

```bash
# Install all dependenices and symlink packages in the workspace (see `pnpm-workspace.yaml`).
$: pnpm install

# Install dependency for a single package.
$: pnpm -F core install vite

# Update a dependency for a single package.
$: pnpm -F core up vite@3.0.0

# Update a dependency for all packages.
$: pnpm up vite@3.0.0 -r
```

## üìù Documentation Site

The documentation site can be found in the `docs/` directory at the root of the project. It's
simply a Vitebook application, refer to the docs itself if you need any guidance.

```bash
# run development environment
$: pnpm docs:dev

# build for production
$: pnpm docs:build

# preview production site
$: pnpm docs:preview
```

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

Vitebook maintains, builds, and distributes multiple [NPM][npm] packages so it's organized as
a [monorepo][monorepo]. All packages are located under the [`packages/`](../packages/) directory,
each within a directory of it's own named after it's package name without the `@vitebook`
organization scope prefix.

- `.scripts/` Node.js scripts used throughout Vitebook.
- `docs/` Documentation site for Vitebook.
- `packages/`
  - `client/` The `@vitebook/client` package which contains the client-side code (built with Svelte)
    such as the router, and lower-level Svelte stores for pages, site options, etc. Themes
    are built on top of the stores and utilities this package provides. This package also
    provides a Vitebook plugin to resolve `.svelte` files as pages, and to support transforms +
    HMR support for them via `@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte`.
  - `core/` The `@vitebook/core` package which contains the code responsible for bootstrapping
    Vitebook (built on top of Vite), and the Vitebook CLI.
  - `create/` The `create-vitebook` package which enables developers to quickly scaffold new
    Vitebook applications via `npm init vitebook`.
  - `markdown/` The `@vitebook/markdown` package which contains the core code for parsing markdown
    files via `markdown-it`, and a Vitebook plugin to transform files on the fly. Other
    framework-specific markdown packages depend on this package for creating the markdown parser
    and any core parser plugins.
  - `markdown-preact/` The `@vitebook/markdown-preact` package which extends `@vitebook/markdown`
    to provide a Vitebook plugin to resolve markdown files as pages, and transform them
    to Preact components.
  - `markdown-prismjs/` The `@vitebook/markdown-prismjs` package contains a markdown plugin
    to extend the markdown parser with syntax highlighting for code blocks using Prismjs.
  - `markdown-shiki/` The `@vitebook/markdown-shiki` package contains a markdown plugin
    to extend the markdown parser with syntax highlighting for code blocks using Shiki.
  - `markdown-svelte/` The `@vitebook/markdown-svelte` package which extends `@vitebook/markdown`
    to provide a Vitebook plugin to resolve markdown files as pages, and transform them to
    Svelte components.
  - `markdown-vue/` The `@vitebook/markdown-vue` package which extends `@vitebook/markdown`
    to provide a Vitebook plugin to resolve markdown files as pages, and transform them to
    Vue components.
  - `preact/` The `@vitebook/preact` package provides a Vitebook plugin to resolve `.jsx` and `.tsx`
    files as pages, and to provide Preact HMR support via `@prefresh/vite`.
  - `theme-default/` The `@vitebook/theme-default` provides a default theme (look and style) for
    Vitebook applications that choose to use it.
  - `vue/` The `@vitebook/vue` package provides a Vitebook plugin to resolve `.vue` files as pages,
    and to support transforms + HMR support for them via `@vitejs/plugin-vue`.
- `sandbox/` This is a safe directory that's ignored by git to build and play with Vitebook
  applications locally, and for testing purposes (more information below).

### Package Anatomy

Each package is organized as follows:

- `bin/` Node.js scripts.
- `dist/` Package distribution files.
  - `client/` Client bundle that's built with TypeScript. Non-typescript files such as `.css`,
    `.svg`, `.vue`, and `.svelte` are copied over via the `copy-non-ts-files.js` script in the
    root `.scripts/` directory.
  - `node/` Node bundle that's built with ESBuild via the `build-node.js` script in the root
    `.scripts/` directory.
  - `shared/` Shared distribution that's built with TypeScript. Both the client and node bundles
    also bundle the shared code and export it individually.
  - `types/` TypeScript declaration files for client, node and shared bundles.
- `src/` Package source files.
  - `client/` Client or browser-specific code.
  - `node/` Node-specific code such as Vitebook plugins.
  - `shared/` Code that is shared between both the client and node.
- `package.json` NPM package descriptor.
- `tsconfig.json` TypeScript configuration file which extends the root `tsconfig.base.json` file.

## üíª Scripts

```bash
# Run eslint and prettier to lint files and look for any code type/style/format issues.
$: pnpm lint

# Run eslint and prettier to lint files and also auto-fix any issues.
$: pnpm format

# Run build in any of the packages in the `packages/` directory.
$: pnpm build client

# Run build and watch for changes to rebuild in any of the packages in the `packages/` directory.
$: pnpm build client -- --watch

# Build all packages in the `packages/` directory.
$: pnpm build:all

# Run a script located inside an example in the `examples/` directory.
$: pnpm example

# Shorthand without running through prompts.
$: pnpm example svelte -- --script vitebook:dev

# Run a script located inside a sandbox application in the `sandbox/` directory.
$: pnpm sandbox

# Shorthand without running through prompts.
$: pnpm sandbox svelte -- --script vitebook:dev
```

## üß™ Sandbox

The `sandbox/` directory at the root of the Vitebook project is where we build and test Vitebook
applications locally. It's safe to include anything inside of this directory as it's ignored
by Git.

We can quickly scaffold applications for local development via the `create-vitebook` package which
can also handle symlinking the `@vitebook/*` packages.

> We're using either NPM or Yarn in the example below because, Vitebook uses a PNPM workspace which
> will only get in the way when running commands inside the sandbox.

```bash
# 1. - make sure all local packages are built.
$: yarn build:all
# or
$: npm run build:all

# 2. - scaffold an application for local development.
$: yarn create vitebook sandbox/svelte --template svelte --theme default --link ../../packages
# or
$: npm init vitebook sandbox/svelte -- --template svelte --theme default --link ../../packages

# 3.
$: yarn --cwd sandbox/svelte
# or
$: npm install --prefix sandbox/svelte

# 4.
$: yarn vitebook:dev --cwd sandbox/svelte
# or
$: npm run vitebook:dev --prefix sandbox/svelte

# 5. - run in another terminal session/window if we need to hack on a package.
$: yarn build theme-default --watch
# or
$: npm run build theme-default -- --watch
```

The `--link ../../packages` CLI option will link any `@vitebook/*` packages based on the link path
provided. For example, `@vitebook/client` will be linked to `../../packages/client`.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Commit

This project uses [semantic commit messages][semantic-commit-style] to automate generating
changelogs and releases. Simply refer to the link, and also see existing commits to get an idea
of how to write your message.

If you've made changes to a specific package, simply include the package name without the
`@vitebook` prefix in the commit scope (see example below).

```bash
# Commit general changes.
$: git commit -m 'chore: your commit message'

# Commit changes made to a specific package (eg: @vitebook/client).
$: git commit -m 'fix(client): your commit message identifying fix'
```

## üéâ Pull Request

**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this free series
[How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub][pr-beginner-series].

Preferably create an issue first on GitHub, and then checkout a branch matching the issue number
(see example below). Once you're done, commit your changes, push to your forked repo, and create
a PR (see link above for more information if it's your first time).

```bash
# Create a branch for your PR, replace {issue-no} with the GitHub issue number.
$: git checkout -b issue-{issue-no}
```
